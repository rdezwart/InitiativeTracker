# Mouki's Initiative Tracker

## What is this?

This is a simple combat helper for Dungeons & Dragons, designed to roll and sort initiative rolls for your party with
the single click of a button. You can find a live version [here](https://rdezwart.github.io/InitiativeTracker/).

## How do I use it?

It's as easy as adding your character's name and bonuses to initiative in a form and hitting a nice green button!
Removing someone is done by selecting their row and hitting another, redder button.

The table comes pre-filled with a selection of characters with a mix of bonuses and hindrances to their rolls to show
you what's possible.

## What if characters tie?

Ties are broken first by checking numeric initiative bonuses, and then if anyone is *still* tied, a D20 is rolled to
determine the final order. These extra D20s are rerolled until two different numbers are achieved.

## Got feedback?

Feel free to leave an issue report if you find something I missed, or if you've got random questions. I mostly made this
for practice and maybe as a portfolio piece.

### Who's Mouki? Do you know him?
